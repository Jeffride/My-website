               <strong>Muaythai:</strong> I have been doing muaythai for 3 years in my local club,
            over the years I have been thought Thai fighting techniques along with
            life skills such as self-discipline.Muaythai, as the name suggests,
            originates from Thailand. It was developed by the military several hundred years
            ago as a form of close-combat that uses the entire body as a weapon.

                team - experience, i enjoyed the many challenges we faced and treasured our victories.

               <strong>Rock-Climbing:</strong> i joined the rock - climbing society in my University
                with little knowledge of what it would entail. In my time thus far in university it has grown to
                become my favourite hobby, i love nothing better than to scale a 30 ft rockface with some friends after a
                long day of lectures.
