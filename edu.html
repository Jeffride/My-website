                            I attended primary school in a local village, my primary school was relatively
                            small and so I knew almost everyone in the school,
                            I am still friends with many of my primary school classmates.

                    <strong>Presentation De La Salle College Bagenalstown:</strong>
                            During my six years in secondary school I gained an array of knowledge in
                            subject such as maths, science and french. For my final two years I chose the subjects:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chemistry</li>
                                <li>Physics</li>
                                <li>Maths</li>
                                <li>French</li>
                                <li>English </li>
                                <li>Accounting</li>
                            </ul>
                            I enjoyed these subjects and in particular I grew a keen interest in physics.
                            I also became very proficient in maths which I now find helpful in my university studies.

                            I am currently studying computer science in UCC, I knew since my 4th year in
                            secondary school that I wanted to do computer science as I have always held a fascination in
                            computers and in particular the software end.
